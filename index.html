<h2 style="background-color:dodgerblue">Business Technology Management</h2>
<p>I am currently enrolled in Business Technology Management at the Toronto Metropolitan University.
    The classes I am currently enrolled in are ITM 415, ITM 780, ITM 618, FIN 300, and GEO 793.<br>
    The class I enjoy the most with my current schedule is ITM 618, since I have found a particular interest in coding.
    I also enjoyed ITM 200, which is a class based on Python.<br>In the future, I would like to do more work related
    to Python or HTML5 since I have a fond understanding and eagerness to learn the programming language.

<h2 style="background-color:tomato">Educational Awards</h2>

<p>Some Educational awards that I have received are Honour roll when I was at <i>Winston Churchill Collegiate Institute.</i> I also received an entrance scholarship from <i>Toronto Metropolitan University</i></p>

<h2 style="background-color:aquamarine">Extracurricular Activities</h2>

<p>An Extracurricular Activity that I found myself particularly interested in was Photography and film making.<br>It started back when I was in high school, and I had a class for photoshop.
    In that class, we had to take photos and photoshop them to fit the requirements of a rubric. After that class, I found myself doing photo and video work outside of school as a hobby. I have
    successfully turned it into a business where I take pictures or videos for clients. I have a couple clients here at the <i>Toronto Metropolitan University</i>.
